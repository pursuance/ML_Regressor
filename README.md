# Regression Visualizer

An interactive web application built with Vite that allows users to upload a CSV file and run a linear regression algorithim on the data.

## Features
* CSV Upload: Easily upload and parse your CSV data.
* Feature Selection: Select the desired independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (label) for the regression model from a user-friendly interface.
* Linear Regression: Runs a standard linear regression algorithm on the selected data.
* Gradient Descent Visualization: Displays a real-time graph of the gradient descent algorithm, showing how the model's error decreases over time.

## Tech Stack
Frontend: Vite, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Data Processing: Utilizes a lightweight library for parsing CSV data.
Visualization: Employs a charting library to render the gradient descent plot.
